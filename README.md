its not using input , mention that its communication using subprocess
ChatGPT said:
Got it ‚Äî thanks for the clarification!
You're right: your simulator does not depend on static input files ‚Äî it directly communicates using subprocess calls (Python runs the C binaries and reads outputs dynamically).

I'll fix that part properly and improve the wording throughout:

Slide 4: Folder Structure (Updated)
java
Copy
Edit
/backend   : C Source Files (scheduler.c, dead.c) + compiled binaries
/frontend  : Python GUI Files (gui.py, deadlock.py)
(no static input files; communication happens dynamically via subprocess)
‚úÖ Note:

Instead of writing to input files manually, Python frontend launches C programs using subprocess calls.

Data is passed dynamically during execution; results are captured and visualized in real-time.

Also minor adjustment in Slide 6 and 7:
Slide 6: How the Scheduler Works (Fixed)
User enters process details through the Python GUI.

Python sends process data to the C backend (scheduler) via subprocess call.

C backend calculates scheduling results and outputs them.

Python reads the output dynamically and generates the Gantt Chart.

Slide 7: How Deadlock Detection Works (Fixed)
User inputs Allocation, Max, and Available matrices via GUI.

Python passes the matrices to C backend (deadlock) via subprocess.

C backend applies Banker's Algorithm:

Finds Safe Sequence, if possible.

Detects Deadlock, if necessary.

Python reads and visualizes the output graph based on backend results.

Summary:

No manual input files are needed.

Subprocess communication between Python and C handles everything dynamically.

Would you also like me to create a shorter version (with 1-2 lines per bullet point) if you need it for a live presentation?
(Usually helps if you're talking and don't want huge paragraphs on your slides.) üöÄ
